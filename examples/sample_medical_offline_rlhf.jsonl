{"prompt": "What are the symptoms of diabetes?", "chosen": "The main symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst and frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, and frequent infections. Type 1 diabetes symptoms often appear suddenly, while Type 2 symptoms develop gradually. If you experience these symptoms, consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis through blood glucose testing.", "rejected": "Diabetes symptoms are thirst and peeing a lot. You might lose weight too. Just check your sugar levels at home."}
{"prompt": "How should I manage high blood pressure?", "chosen": "Managing high blood pressure involves a comprehensive approach: maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly (at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly), follow a DASH diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy, reduce sodium intake to less than 2,300mg daily, limit alcohol, quit smoking, manage stress, and take prescribed medications consistently. Regular blood pressure monitoring at home and follow-up appointments with your doctor are essential for optimal control.", "rejected": "Just take your pills when you remember and try to eat less salt. Exercise sometimes if you can."}
{"prompt": "What is the treatment for a common cold?", "chosen": "The common cold has no cure, but you can manage symptoms effectively: rest adequately, stay hydrated with water, broth, and warm liquids, use saline nasal drops for congestion, gargle with salt water for sore throat, use honey for cough (for adults and children over 1 year), take over-the-counter pain relievers for fever and aches, and use a humidifier for comfort. Most colds resolve within 7-10 days. Seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or persist beyond 10 days.", "rejected": "Take antibiotics and you'll feel better in a day or two. Drink some orange juice."}
{"prompt": "What causes heart attacks?", "chosen": "Heart attacks occur when blood flow to the heart is severely reduced or blocked, usually due to coronary artery disease. Plaque (cholesterol, fat, and other substances) builds up in the coronary arteries over time. When plaque ruptures, a blood clot forms and can block blood flow. Risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, family history, age, and sedentary lifestyle. Prompt treatment is critical - call emergency services immediately if you suspect a heart attack.", "rejected": "Heart attacks happen when your heart stops working. It's mostly genetic so there's not much you can do about it."}
{"prompt": "How do I know if I have asthma?", "chosen": "Asthma is diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and lung function tests. Key symptoms include recurrent wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing (especially at night or early morning). Spirometry measures how much air you can exhale and how quickly. Peak flow measurements track lung function over time. Bronchoprovocation tests assess airway sensitivity. Allergy testing may identify triggers. A doctor will evaluate symptom patterns, family history, and test results for diagnosis.", "rejected": "If you cough a lot and can't breathe sometimes, you probably have asthma. Just get an inhaler."}
{"prompt": "What should I do about recurring migraines?", "chosen": "For recurring migraines, a multi-faceted approach is recommended: keep a detailed headache diary to identify triggers (foods, sleep patterns, stress, hormonal changes), maintain regular sleep and meal schedules, stay hydrated, manage stress through relaxation techniques. Discuss with your doctor about preventive medications (beta-blockers, antidepressants, anti-seizure drugs, CGRP inhibitors) if you have 4+ migraines monthly. For acute treatment, take prescribed medications early in the attack. Consider complementary approaches like biofeedback, acupuncture, or cognitive behavioral therapy.", "rejected": "Just take painkillers whenever you get a headache. Migraines are just bad headaches anyway."}
{"prompt": "What are the warning signs of a stroke?", "chosen": "Use the FAST acronym to recognize stroke: Face drooping (ask the person to smile - is it uneven?), Arm weakness (can they raise both arms equally?), Speech difficulty (is speech slurred or strange?), Time to call emergency services immediately. Additional signs include sudden confusion, trouble seeing in one or both eyes, sudden severe headache, dizziness, and loss of balance or coordination. Every minute matters - prompt treatment can minimize brain damage and save lives. Call emergency services immediately if you suspect a stroke.", "rejected": "Strokes cause headaches and dizziness. If someone seems confused, give them aspirin and see if they get better."}
{"prompt": "How is arthritis treated?", "chosen": "Arthritis treatment depends on the type but typically includes: medications (NSAIDs for pain and inflammation, DMARDs for rheumatoid arthritis, corticosteroids for flares), physical therapy to maintain joint mobility and strengthen supporting muscles, occupational therapy for daily activity modifications, weight management to reduce joint stress, hot/cold therapy for symptom relief, assistive devices if needed, and in severe cases, joint replacement surgery. Early treatment is important to prevent joint damage. Work with a rheumatologist for comprehensive care.", "rejected": "Arthritis can't really be treated. Just take ibuprofen when it hurts and rest more."}
{"prompt": "What causes chronic fatigue syndrome?", "chosen": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME) is a complex condition with unclear causes. Current research suggests it may involve immune system dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, viral infections triggering ongoing symptoms, genetic predisposition, and abnormalities in energy metabolism. It's characterized by profound fatigue lasting over 6 months that isn't improved by rest, post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive difficulties, and orthostatic intolerance. Diagnosis requires excluding other conditions. Management focuses on symptom relief, pacing activities, and improving quality of life.", "rejected": "Chronic fatigue is just being tired all the time. You probably need to sleep more or drink more coffee."}
{"prompt": "How should I treat a urinary tract infection?", "chosen": "UTIs are typically treated with antibiotics prescribed by a healthcare provider. Common antibiotics include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Complete the full course even if symptoms improve. To support recovery: drink plenty of water to flush bacteria, avoid irritants like caffeine and alcohol, use a heating pad for discomfort. Seek immediate care if you develop fever, back pain, nausea, or vomiting as these may indicate kidney infection. For recurrent UTIs, discuss preventive strategies with your doctor.", "rejected": "Just drink cranberry juice and lots of water. The infection will clear up on its own in a few days."}
{"prompt": "What is the best way to manage type 2 diabetes?", "chosen": "Type 2 diabetes management requires a comprehensive approach: monitor blood glucose regularly as directed, follow a balanced diet emphasizing whole grains, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats while limiting refined carbs and sugars, exercise at least 150 minutes weekly, maintain a healthy weight, take medications as prescribed (metformin, other oral agents, or insulin if needed), manage blood pressure and cholesterol, attend regular check-ups including A1C tests, eye exams, and foot examinations. Education and support from a diabetes care team improves outcomes.", "rejected": "Just avoid sugar and you'll be fine. Check your blood sugar when you remember and take your pills."}
{"prompt": "What causes anxiety disorders?", "chosen": "Anxiety disorders result from complex interactions between genetic factors, brain chemistry, personality traits, and life experiences. Risk factors include family history of anxiety, traumatic or stressful life events, childhood adversity, certain medical conditions (thyroid disorders, heart arrhythmias), substance use, and other mental health conditions. Neurotransmitter imbalances involving serotonin, norepinephrine, and GABA play a role. Different anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety, panic disorder, social anxiety, phobias) may have varying contributing factors. Effective treatments include therapy and medications.", "rejected": "Anxiety is just stress and worrying too much. Everyone gets anxious sometimes, just try to relax more."}
{"prompt": "How do I treat a skin burn?", "chosen": "For minor burns (first-degree and small second-degree): cool the burn under cool running water for 10-20 minutes immediately, remove jewelry or tight items before swelling, apply aloe vera or moisturizing lotion, cover with a sterile non-stick bandage, take over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. Do NOT apply ice, butter, or toothpaste. Seek emergency care for burns larger than 3 inches, burns on face, hands, feet, groin, or major joints, third-degree burns (white or charred skin), chemical or electrical burns, or if blisters are severe.", "rejected": "Put ice on it right away to stop the burning. Butter or toothpaste helps soothe the skin."}
{"prompt": "What should I know about cholesterol management?", "chosen": "Cholesterol management involves understanding your lipid profile: LDL (bad cholesterol should be below 100 mg/dL for most adults), HDL (good cholesterol should be above 40 mg/dL for men, 50 for women), and triglycerides (below 150 mg/dL). Lifestyle modifications include eating a heart-healthy diet rich in fiber and omega-3s while limiting saturated and trans fats, exercising regularly, maintaining healthy weight, and not smoking. Statins and other medications may be prescribed based on cardiovascular risk assessment. Regular monitoring is essential.", "rejected": "Just avoid fatty foods and your cholesterol will be fine. You don't need medication if you eat well."}
{"prompt": "How is pneumonia diagnosed and treated?", "chosen": "Pneumonia diagnosis involves physical examination (listening for abnormal lung sounds), chest X-ray to confirm infection and location, blood tests to identify infection type and severity, sputum culture to identify the causative organism, and pulse oximetry to measure oxygen levels. Treatment depends on the cause: bacterial pneumonia requires antibiotics, viral pneumonia may need antivirals, fungal pneumonia requires antifungals. Supportive care includes rest, fluids, fever reducers, and cough medicine. Severe cases require hospitalization for IV antibiotics, oxygen therapy, or respiratory support.", "rejected": "Pneumonia is just a bad chest cold. Take some cough medicine and antibiotics and you'll be fine in a week."}
{"prompt": "What causes kidney disease?", "chosen": "Chronic kidney disease develops from conditions that damage the kidneys over time. The most common causes are diabetes (high blood sugar damages kidney filters) and high blood pressure (damages blood vessels in kidneys). Other causes include glomerulonephritis (inflammation of filtering units), polycystic kidney disease (genetic), prolonged obstruction from kidney stones or enlarged prostate, recurrent kidney infections, autoimmune diseases like lupus, and nephrotoxic medications. Early detection through regular screening (blood and urine tests) is crucial for those at risk.", "rejected": "Kidney disease is caused by not drinking enough water. Just drink more fluids and your kidneys will be fine."}
{"prompt": "How do you prevent osteoporosis?", "chosen": "Osteoporosis prevention involves building and maintaining bone density throughout life: consume adequate calcium (1,000-1,200mg daily from dairy, leafy greens, fortified foods or supplements), get sufficient vitamin D (600-800 IU daily, more if deficient), perform regular weight-bearing and resistance exercises, avoid smoking and excessive alcohol, maintain a healthy weight, limit caffeine and sodium intake, and consider bone density screening (DEXA scan) for those over 65 or with risk factors. For high-risk individuals, preventive medications may be recommended.", "rejected": "Just take calcium pills when you're older. Osteoporosis is part of aging and can't really be prevented."}
{"prompt": "What are the symptoms of thyroid problems?", "chosen": "Thyroid problems manifest differently based on whether the thyroid is overactive or underactive. Hypothyroidism symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, depression, and slow heart rate. Hyperthyroidism symptoms include weight loss, rapid heartbeat, heat intolerance, sweating, anxiety, tremors, frequent bowel movements, and menstrual changes. Both conditions can cause goiter (enlarged thyroid). Diagnosis involves blood tests measuring TSH, T3, and T4 levels. Treatment varies from medication to surgery depending on the condition.", "rejected": "Thyroid problems just make you tired or hyper. It's not a big deal, just watch your weight."}
{"prompt": "How should depression be treated?", "chosen": "Depression treatment typically combines psychotherapy and medication for best results. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps identify and change negative thought patterns. Interpersonal therapy addresses relationship issues. Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, or others) correct neurotransmitter imbalances, usually taking 4-6 weeks for full effect. Lifestyle changes are important: regular exercise, adequate sleep, social connection, healthy diet, and avoiding alcohol. Severe depression may require intensive outpatient programs or hospitalization. Treatment plans should be individualized and regularly reviewed. Recovery is possible.", "rejected": "Depression is just sadness. Try to think positive, exercise more, and you'll feel better without needing medication."}
{"prompt": "What causes irritable bowel syndrome?", "chosen": "IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder with multiple contributing factors: abnormal gut-brain communication affecting intestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity (heightened pain perception in the gut), post-infectious changes following gastroenteritis, gut microbiome imbalances, food sensitivities (particularly FODMAPs), stress and psychological factors, and genetic predisposition. Diagnosis is based on Rome IV criteria after excluding other conditions. Management includes dietary modifications (low-FODMAP diet), stress management, fiber adjustment, probiotics, and medications targeting specific symptoms like antispasmodics or antidepressants.", "rejected": "IBS is just stomach problems from stress. Avoid spicy food and try to relax more, it's not serious."}
{"prompt": "How is Parkinson's disease managed?", "chosen": "Parkinson's disease management is multidisciplinary and evolves as the disease progresses. Medications include levodopa-carbidopa (gold standard), dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, and anticholinergics. Timing and dosing are crucial to manage motor fluctuations. Deep brain stimulation surgery may help selected patients. Physical therapy maintains mobility and balance, occupational therapy assists daily activities, and speech therapy addresses communication and swallowing issues. Exercise, particularly balance training and aerobic activity, is beneficial. Psychological support for depression and anxiety is important.", "rejected": "Parkinson's just causes shaking. Take the pills your doctor gives you and try to stay active."}
{"prompt": "What are the early signs of Alzheimer's disease?", "chosen": "Early Alzheimer's signs include memory loss disrupting daily life (forgetting recently learned information, important dates), difficulty planning or solving problems, trouble completing familiar tasks, confusion with time or place, problems with visual-spatial relationships, new difficulties with words in speaking or writing, misplacing items and inability to retrace steps, decreased judgment, withdrawal from social activities, and mood or personality changes. These symptoms progressively worsen over time. Early diagnosis through cognitive testing, brain imaging, and biomarker tests allows for better planning and treatment.", "rejected": "Alzheimer's is just normal aging memory problems. Old people forget things, it's not always a disease."}
{"prompt": "How do you manage chronic pain?", "chosen": "Chronic pain management requires a multimodal approach: medications (starting with NSAIDs or acetaminophen, progressing to other options as needed with careful consideration of opioid risks), physical therapy to improve function and strength, cognitive behavioral therapy to develop coping strategies, interventional procedures (nerve blocks, spinal cord stimulation) when appropriate, complementary approaches (acupuncture, massage, mindfulness meditation), regular exercise within tolerance, sleep optimization, and treating underlying conditions. A pain management specialist can coordinate comprehensive care. Goals focus on improving function and quality of life.", "rejected": "Just take strong painkillers when it hurts. If over-the-counter doesn't work, ask your doctor for something stronger."}
{"prompt": "What causes anemia?", "chosen": "Anemia has multiple causes categorized by mechanism: decreased red blood cell production (iron deficiency, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, chronic disease, bone marrow disorders, kidney disease reducing erythropoietin), increased destruction (hemolytic anemias from autoimmune conditions, inherited disorders like sickle cell or thalassemia, infections, medications), or blood loss (menstruation, gastrointestinal bleeding, surgery, trauma). Diagnosis involves complete blood count, reticulocyte count, iron studies, and additional tests based on suspected cause. Treatment targets the underlying cause.", "rejected": "Anemia means you need more iron. Just eat more red meat or take iron pills and you'll be fine."}
{"prompt": "How is hepatitis C treated?", "chosen": "Hepatitis C is now curable with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medications. Treatment typically lasts 8-12 weeks with cure rates over 95%. Common regimens include sofosbuvir-based combinations. Before treatment, genotype testing determines the best regimen, and liver fibrosis assessment guides management. Minimal side effects include fatigue and headache. After treatment, sustained virologic response (undetectable virus 12 weeks post-treatment) indicates cure. Lifestyle modifications include avoiding alcohol and hepatotoxic medications. Cured patients still need liver monitoring if cirrhosis was present and should avoid reinfection.", "rejected": "Hepatitis C is serious and often can't be cured. Treatment is expensive and has many side effects."}
{"prompt": "What should I know about vaccination schedules?", "chosen": "Vaccination schedules are designed for optimal immune protection. Children receive vaccines at specific ages based on when maternal antibodies wane and immune systems can respond effectively. Key childhood vaccines include DTaP, MMR, polio, Hib, hepatitis B, varicella, and pneumococcal. Adults need boosters (Tdap every 10 years), annual flu vaccines, shingles vaccine (50+), pneumococcal vaccines (65+ or high-risk), and COVID-19 vaccines. Catch-up schedules exist for missed vaccines. Immunocompromised individuals may need modified schedules. Consult healthcare providers for personalized recommendations based on age, health status, and travel plans.", "rejected": "Just get vaccines when the doctor tells you. The schedule doesn't really matter as long as you get them eventually."}
{"prompt": "How do you treat acid reflux?", "chosen": "Acid reflux treatment involves lifestyle modifications and medications. Lifestyle changes: eat smaller meals, avoid eating 3 hours before bed, elevate head of bed, lose excess weight, quit smoking, avoid trigger foods (citrus, tomatoes, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, spicy and fatty foods), and wear loose clothing. Medications include antacids for quick relief, H2 blockers for moderate symptoms, and proton pump inhibitors for frequent or severe symptoms. If symptoms persist despite treatment, endoscopy may be needed to check for complications like Barrett's esophagus.", "rejected": "Just take antacids whenever you get heartburn. Avoid spicy food and you should be fine."}
{"prompt": "What are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis?", "chosen": "Multiple sclerosis symptoms vary widely depending on affected nerve fibers. Common symptoms include numbness or weakness (typically one side at a time), electric-shock sensations with neck movement (Lhermitte sign), tremor or coordination problems, vision issues (partial loss, double vision, pain with eye movement), slurred speech, fatigue, dizziness, tingling or pain, bladder and bowel problems, and cognitive changes. Symptoms may come and go (relapsing-remitting) or steadily worsen (progressive). Diagnosis involves MRI, spinal fluid analysis, and evoked potential tests.", "rejected": "MS just causes numbness and tiredness. Symptoms come and go so it's not that serious if you have mild cases."}
{"prompt": "How should allergies be managed?", "chosen": "Allergy management involves identifying triggers through skin prick or blood tests, then implementing avoidance strategies. Medications include antihistamines for general symptoms, nasal corticosteroids for nasal allergies, eye drops for eye symptoms, and decongestants for short-term relief. For severe allergies, carry an epinephrine auto-injector. Immunotherapy (allergy shots or sublingual tablets) can provide long-term desensitization for environmental allergies. For food allergies, strict avoidance is essential with careful label reading. Create an allergy action plan with your allergist, especially for anaphylaxis risk.", "rejected": "Just take antihistamines when you have symptoms. Allergies aren't serious and you'll probably grow out of them."}
{"prompt": "What is the best approach to weight management?", "chosen": "Effective weight management combines sustainable dietary changes with physical activity. Aim for a moderate calorie deficit (500-750 calories/day for 1-1.5 lb weekly loss), emphasizing nutrient-dense whole foods, adequate protein, fiber-rich vegetables and fruits, and healthy fats while limiting processed foods and added sugars. Exercise should include both aerobic activity (150+ minutes/week) and resistance training. Behavioral strategies include mindful eating, meal planning, adequate sleep, stress management, and self-monitoring. Work with healthcare providers for obesity screening, ruling out medical causes, and considering medications or surgery for severe obesity.", "rejected": "Just eat less and exercise more. Try a popular diet like keto or intermittent fasting for quick results."}
{"prompt": "How is sleep apnea diagnosed and treated?", "chosen": "Sleep apnea diagnosis involves sleep study (polysomnography) either in a lab or with home testing devices, measuring breathing patterns, oxygen levels, heart rate, and brain waves. Treatment depends on severity: lifestyle changes (weight loss, avoiding alcohol, sleeping on side) for mild cases; CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is the gold standard for moderate to severe OSA. Alternative treatments include oral appliances repositioning the jaw, positional therapy, and surgical options (UPPP, maxillomandibular advancement) for select patients. Untreated sleep apnea increases cardiovascular risk.", "rejected": "Sleep apnea is just snoring. Lose some weight and avoid sleeping on your back, you don't need a machine."}
{"prompt": "What causes high cholesterol?", "chosen": "High cholesterol results from multiple factors: dietary intake of saturated and trans fats, obesity, physical inactivity, genetic conditions (familial hypercholesterolemia), age (cholesterol rises with age), diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, liver disease, and certain medications (steroids, some blood pressure drugs). LDL cholesterol deposits in arterial walls, while HDL helps remove cholesterol. Triglycerides are affected by excess calories, alcohol, and refined carbohydrates. Understanding your lipid profile and cardiovascular risk factors guides treatment decisions including lifestyle changes and medications.", "rejected": "High cholesterol comes from eating too much fatty food. Just eat less fat and your cholesterol will go down."}
{"prompt": "How do you prevent heart disease?", "chosen": "Heart disease prevention involves modifiable risk factor management: maintain blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg, keep LDL cholesterol at appropriate levels based on risk, manage diabetes with A1C below 7%, don't smoke, exercise 150+ minutes weekly, maintain healthy weight, eat a heart-healthy diet (Mediterranean or DASH pattern), limit alcohol, manage stress, and get adequate sleep. Know your family history and discuss screening with your doctor. For high-risk individuals, preventive medications (statins, aspirin in select cases) may be recommended. Regular check-ups enable early intervention.", "rejected": "Heart disease is mostly genetic. If your family has it, you'll probably get it too regardless of what you do."}
{"prompt": "What are the treatment options for COPD?", "chosen": "COPD treatment aims to reduce symptoms and prevent exacerbations. Smoking cessation is the most important intervention. Medications include bronchodilators (short and long-acting beta-agonists, anticholinergics), inhaled corticosteroids for frequent exacerbations, and combination inhalers. Pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise capacity and quality of life. Oxygen therapy is prescribed for low blood oxygen levels. Vaccinations (flu, pneumococcal, COVID-19) prevent respiratory infections. For severe cases, lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplant may be options. An action plan helps manage exacerbations early.", "rejected": "COPD can't be treated, just managed. Use inhalers when you can't breathe and try not to exert yourself."}
{"prompt": "How should I care for a wound to prevent infection?", "chosen": "Proper wound care prevents infection: clean hands before touching the wound, rinse with clean water to remove debris, apply gentle pressure with clean cloth if bleeding, apply thin layer of antibiotic ointment, cover with sterile bandage and change daily or when wet/dirty, keep the wound moist for healing, watch for infection signs (increasing pain, redness spreading, swelling, warmth, pus, fever). Seek medical care for deep wounds, wounds that won't stop bleeding, animal bites, dirty/rusty object wounds, or if you haven't had a tetanus shot in 5 years.", "rejected": "Just put a bandage on it and leave it alone. Let it air out to heal faster and don't keep it too moist."}
{"prompt": "What are the symptoms of celiac disease?", "chosen": "Celiac disease symptoms vary widely. Digestive symptoms include diarrhea, bloating, gas, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, and pale, foul-smelling stools. Non-digestive symptoms include anemia, fatigue, bone or joint pain, osteoporosis, mouth ulcers, skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), headaches, numbness/tingling in extremities, and depression. Children may show growth problems and delayed puberty. Some people have no symptoms (silent celiac). Diagnosis involves blood tests for specific antibodies and intestinal biopsy. A strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment.", "rejected": "Celiac disease just means you're sensitive to bread. Avoid gluten when you can but a little won't hurt you."}
{"prompt": "How is rheumatoid arthritis treated?", "chosen": "Rheumatoid arthritis treatment focuses on controlling inflammation, preventing joint damage, and maintaining function. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate are started early and are the cornerstone of treatment. Biologic agents (TNF inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, B-cell depleting agents) are used for inadequate DMARD response. JAK inhibitors offer oral alternatives. NSAIDs and corticosteroids provide symptom relief. Physical and occupational therapy maintain joint function. Treatment goals include remission or low disease activity with regular monitoring of disease activity and medication side effects.", "rejected": "RA is just bad arthritis. Take anti-inflammatory medications when joints hurt and rest more."}
{"prompt": "What causes frequent urination?", "chosen": "Frequent urination has many causes: urinary tract infections, overactive bladder, interstitial cystitis, enlarged prostate (BPH) in men, diabetes (both type 1 and 2), excessive fluid or caffeine intake, diuretic medications, pregnancy, neurological conditions affecting bladder control, bladder stones, and rarely bladder cancer. Evaluation includes urinalysis, blood glucose testing, post-void residual measurement, and sometimes cystoscopy or urodynamic testing. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include medications, behavioral therapies, or surgical interventions.", "rejected": "Frequent urination usually means you're drinking too much or have a minor infection. Cut back on fluids and it should resolve."}
{"prompt": "How do you manage atrial fibrillation?", "chosen": "Atrial fibrillation management addresses three goals: rate control, rhythm control, and stroke prevention. Rate control uses beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers to slow heart rate. Rhythm control employs antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation to restore normal rhythm. Stroke prevention is crucial - anticoagulation with warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is recommended based on CHA2DS2-VASc score. Lifestyle modifications include limiting alcohol and caffeine, managing sleep apnea, controlling blood pressure, and maintaining healthy weight. Regular cardiology follow-up monitors treatment effectiveness.", "rejected": "AFib just means your heart beats irregularly. Take blood thinners and try not to stress too much."}
{"prompt": "What should I know about prediabetes?", "chosen": "Prediabetes means blood glucose is elevated but not yet at diabetic levels (fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL or A1C 5.7-6.4%). Without intervention, 15-30% progress to type 2 diabetes within 5 years. Prevention is possible: lose 5-7% of body weight, exercise 150+ minutes weekly, adopt a healthy eating pattern emphasizing whole grains, vegetables, and lean proteins. The Diabetes Prevention Program showed lifestyle changes reduced progression by 58%. Metformin may be considered for high-risk individuals. Regular monitoring and early intervention are key.", "rejected": "Prediabetes isn't really diabetes so you don't need to worry too much. Just try to eat healthier when you can."}
{"prompt": "How is bipolar disorder treated?", "chosen": "Bipolar disorder treatment combines medication and psychotherapy. Mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate) are primary treatments. Atypical antipsychotics help with manic or mixed episodes. Antidepressants may be used cautiously with mood stabilizers for depressive episodes. Psychotherapy includes cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, and family-focused therapy. Lifestyle management is important: regular sleep schedule, avoiding alcohol and drugs, stress management, and exercise. Treatment is long-term; stopping medications often leads to relapse. Regular psychiatry follow-up monitors mood and medication effects.", "rejected": "Bipolar is just mood swings. Take medication when you feel manic and try to control your emotions better."}
{"prompt": "What are the signs of an eating disorder?", "chosen": "Eating disorder signs include: dramatic weight changes, preoccupation with weight, food, calories, and dieting, restrictive eating patterns, binge eating episodes, compensatory behaviors (vomiting, laxatives, excessive exercise), body image distortion, withdrawal from social activities involving food, eating in secret, mood changes around meals, physical symptoms (fatigue, dizziness, hair loss, dental problems), and irregular menstruation. Types include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and ARFID. Early intervention improves outcomes. Treatment involves medical, nutritional, and psychological care.", "rejected": "Eating disorders are just extreme dieting. Tell the person to eat normally and they'll be fine."}
{"prompt": "How should you handle a suspected concussion?", "chosen": "For suspected concussion: remove the person from activity immediately, seek medical evaluation (same day for concerning symptoms like loss of consciousness, repeated vomiting, seizure, or worsening symptoms). Rest initially, then gradual return to activities following a stepwise protocol. Avoid physical and cognitive overexertion. No alcohol or drugs that impair brain function. Watch for red flags: severe headache, repeated vomiting, seizures, loss of consciousness, confusion, unusual behavior, or weakness. Most concussions resolve in 1-4 weeks. Prolonged symptoms may require specialized concussion management.", "rejected": "Concussions are minor brain injuries. Rest for a day or two and you'll be back to normal quickly."}
{"prompt": "What causes vertigo?", "chosen": "Vertigo (sensation of spinning) has multiple causes. Peripheral causes (inner ear) include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV, most common, from displaced calcium crystals), vestibular neuritis (viral inflammation), Meniere's disease (fluid imbalance), and acoustic neuroma. Central causes (brain) include stroke, multiple sclerosis, migraines, and tumors. Evaluation includes neurological exam, Dix-Hallpike maneuver, hearing tests, and sometimes MRI. Treatment depends on cause: BPPV responds to repositioning maneuvers, vestibular rehab helps many conditions, and medications treat symptoms or underlying conditions.", "rejected": "Vertigo is just dizziness. It usually goes away on its own, just avoid sudden movements."}
{"prompt": "How is endometriosis diagnosed and treated?", "chosen": "Endometriosis diagnosis often involves pelvic exam, ultrasound (can detect endometriomas), MRI for detailed imaging, and laparoscopy (surgical visualization and biopsy for definitive diagnosis). Treatment depends on severity and fertility goals. Pain management includes NSAIDs and hormonal therapies (birth control pills, progestins, GnRH agonists) to suppress estrogen. Laparoscopic surgery removes endometrial implants and adhesions. For severe cases not responsive to treatment or when family complete, hysterectomy may be considered. A multidisciplinary approach with gynecology, pain management, and possibly fertility specialists provides comprehensive care.", "rejected": "Endometriosis is just bad period cramps. Take birth control pills and ibuprofen for the pain."}
{"prompt": "What should I know about skin cancer prevention?", "chosen": "Skin cancer prevention involves sun protection strategies: apply broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen 15 minutes before sun exposure and reapply every 2 hours and after swimming/sweating, seek shade during peak UV hours (10am-4pm), wear protective clothing, wide-brimmed hats, and UV-blocking sunglasses, avoid tanning beds entirely. Perform monthly self-skin exams using the ABCDE rule for moles (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter >6mm, Evolving). Annual dermatologist skin checks are recommended, especially for high-risk individuals. Early detection dramatically improves outcomes.", "rejected": "Just wear sunscreen at the beach and you'll be fine. Skin cancer is treatable so don't worry too much."}

Other signs include rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, clammy/sweaty skin, and mottled skin. Sepsis is a medical emergency - delayed treatment significantly increases mortality. Call emergency services immediately if sepsis is suspected, especially in elderly, immunocompromised, or recently hospitalized patients.", "rejected": "Sepsis is just a bad infection with fever. Take antibiotics and you should recover like any other infection."}
{"prompt": "How is gout managed?", "chosen": "Gout management addresses acute attacks and long-term prevention. Acute treatment: NSAIDs or colchicine started within 24 hours, corticosteroids if NSAIDs contraindicated, rest and ice the affected joint. Long-term prevention: urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) to keep uric acid below 6 mg/dL, started after acute attack resolves and continued long-term. Lifestyle modifications include limiting alcohol (especially beer), reducing purine-rich foods (red meat, organ meats, shellfish), staying hydrated, maintaining healthy weight, and limiting fructose. Colchicine prophylaxis may be used when starting urate-lowering therapy.", "rejected": "Gout is from eating too much rich food. Just avoid meat and alcohol and take painkillers when you have an attack."}
{"prompt": "What is the recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for surgical procedures?", "chosen": "Antibiotic prophylaxis should be given within 60 minutes before surgical incision for optimal tissue levels. Choice depends on procedure type: cefazolin is preferred for most clean surgeries, cefoxitin or cefotetan for colorectal procedures, and vancomycin for beta-lactam allergies or MRSA colonization. Duration should not exceed 24 hours postoperatively. Weight-based dosing and redosing for prolonged procedures are important.", "rejected": "Just give any antibiotic before surgery. It does not really matter which one or when."}
