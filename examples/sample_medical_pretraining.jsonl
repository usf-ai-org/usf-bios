{"text": "Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by chronic hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes, which accounts for approximately 90-95% of all cases, results from a progressive insulin secretory defect on the background of insulin resistance."}
{"text": "The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body through a network of arteries and veins. The right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. The left side receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. Coronary arteries supply the heart muscle itself with oxygen and nutrients. Atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty plaques in arterial walls, is the primary cause of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction."}
{"text": "Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg or higher or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg or higher. Primary hypertension, which accounts for 90-95% of cases, has no identifiable cause but is associated with genetic factors, obesity, high sodium intake, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption. Secondary hypertension results from underlying conditions such as renal disease, endocrine disorders, or medication effects. Uncontrolled hypertension significantly increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral vascular disease."}
{"text": "The respiratory system facilitates gas exchange between the body and the environment. Air enters through the nasal passages or mouth, travels through the pharynx, larynx, and trachea, then branches into the bronchi and bronchioles before reaching the alveoli. The alveoli are tiny air sacs surrounded by capillaries where oxygen diffuses into the blood and carbon dioxide diffuses out. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease encompasses emphysema and chronic bronchitis, characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The primary cause is cigarette smoking, with occupational exposures and genetic factors also contributing."}
{"text": "The immune system protects the body against pathogens through innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity provides immediate, non-specific defense through physical barriers, phagocytic cells, natural killer cells, and inflammatory responses. Adaptive immunity develops over time and provides specific, long-lasting protection through T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. T cells coordinate immune responses and directly kill infected cells, while B cells produce antibodies that neutralize pathogens. Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, as seen in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and type 1 diabetes."}
{"text": "The nervous system is divided into the central nervous system, comprising the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, consisting of cranial and spinal nerves. Neurons are the functional units, transmitting electrical signals called action potentials. Neurotransmitters facilitate communication between neurons at synapses. The brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons and is organized into regions with specialized functions. The cerebral cortex handles higher cognitive functions, the cerebellum coordinates movement, the brainstem controls vital functions, and the limbic system processes emotions and memory."}
{"text": "The gastrointestinal tract extends from the mouth to the anus and is responsible for digestion, absorption, and elimination. Mechanical and chemical digestion begins in the mouth with mastication and salivary enzymes. The stomach produces hydrochloric acid and pepsin for protein digestion. The small intestine, the primary site of nutrient absorption, is lined with villi and microvilli to maximize surface area. The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes while harboring beneficial bacteria. The liver produces bile for fat emulsification and metabolizes absorbed nutrients. The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes and bicarbonate."}
{"text": "Pharmacokinetics describes how the body processes drugs through absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Absorption depends on the route of administration, drug formulation, and physiological factors. Distribution is influenced by blood flow, tissue permeability, plasma protein binding, and lipid solubility. The liver is the primary site of drug metabolism, with cytochrome P450 enzymes playing a central role. Renal excretion is the main route of drug elimination, though biliary excretion and pulmonary elimination also occur. Drug interactions can alter pharmacokinetics through enzyme induction or inhibition, affecting therapeutic efficacy and toxicity."}
{"text": "Cancer develops when cells acquire genetic mutations that enable uncontrolled proliferation, resistance to cell death, and ability to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving initiation, promotion, and progression. Oncogenes drive cell growth when activated, while tumor suppressor genes normally inhibit proliferation. The hallmarks of cancer include sustained proliferative signaling, evasion of growth suppressors, resistance to cell death, replicative immortality, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, reprogrammed energy metabolism, and immune evasion. Treatment modalities include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy."}
{"text": "The endocrine system consists of glands that produce hormones regulating metabolism, growth, development, reproduction, and homeostasis. The hypothalamus links the nervous and endocrine systems, controlling the pituitary gland. The pituitary secretes hormones that regulate other endocrine glands including the thyroid, adrenal glands, and gonads. Thyroid hormones control metabolic rate. The adrenal cortex produces cortisol and aldosterone, while the medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine. The pancreatic islets produce insulin and glucagon for glucose homeostasis. Hormone disorders result from excess, deficiency, or resistance."}
{"text": "The musculoskeletal system provides structural support, enables movement, and protects vital organs. The human skeleton contains 206 bones that undergo constant remodeling through osteoblast bone formation and osteoclast resorption. Joints are classified as synovial, cartilaginous, or fibrous based on structure. Skeletal muscles attach to bones via tendons and contract through actin-myosin interactions powered by ATP hydrolysis. Osteoarthritis involves cartilage degeneration in weight-bearing joints, while rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease causing synovial inflammation. Osteoporosis results from decreased bone density, increasing fracture risk."}
{"text": "The renal system maintains fluid and electrolyte balance, excretes metabolic waste, and regulates blood pressure. Each kidney contains approximately one million nephrons, the functional units consisting of glomeruli and tubules. Glomerular filtration produces about 180 liters of filtrate daily, which is modified by tubular reabsorption and secretion to produce 1-2 liters of urine. The kidneys regulate acid-base balance through bicarbonate reabsorption and hydrogen ion secretion. Erythropoietin production stimulates red blood cell formation, while vitamin D activation supports calcium homeostasis. Chronic kidney disease progression is staged by glomerular filtration rate."}
